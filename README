For this to work you must enable "Audit Process Creation" in your group policy settings
You must create a file with the paths to all of your IDE/programming tool executable paths and chage the path in line 24 of megyKodService.py
Note: currently only works properly in debug mode. Windows services cannot create message windows :(

 to start the service execute the following in an admin command prompt:
    "python megyKodServicee.py install"
    "python megyKodServicee.py start"
 to stop and remove the service:
    "python megyKodServicee.py stop"
    "python megyKodServicee.py remove"
 there is also a debug that will run the service from the terminal after it has been installed:
    "python megyKodServicee.py debug"

 in case of error 1053 when starting the service add python to your SYSTEM path variable
